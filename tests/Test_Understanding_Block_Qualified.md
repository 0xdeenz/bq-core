BLOCK_QUALIFIED_TITLE: Understanding Block Qualified  
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_DESCRIPTION: This test aims to evaluate your knowledge of the technology behind Block Qualified, while also serving as a starting point and tutorial for the DApp.

BLOCK_QUALIFIED_QUESTION_START: What does Block Qualified allow you to do?  
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: Create and gain credentials on-chain.  
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: Take your off-chain credentials and move them on-chain.  
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: Ask and answer questions on-chain to gain credentials.  
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: Create and gain credentials off-chain and verify them on-chain.  
  
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_QUESTION_START: What is the difference between Block Qualified Testers, *BQT*, and Credentials, *BQC*?  
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: None, both function interchangeably.  
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: They are linked to each other and work as one.  
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: Credentials are linked to testers and gained after solving them.  
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: Testers include all the necessary information to solve credentials.  
  
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_QUESTION_START: Can Block Qualified Testers, *BQT*, and Credentials, *BQC*, be transferred?  
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: Yes, both testers and credentials can be transferred.  
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: No, neither testers nor credentials can be transferred.  
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: Testers can be transferred, but credentials cannot.  
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: Testers cannot be transferred, but credentials can.  
  
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_QUESTION_START: Alice is interested in hiring Bob for a blockchain developer position, but she wants to test his knowledge and experience first. To do this,she decides to create a Block Qualified Tester made up of 20 questions, with 6 possible answers each, with what she deems are the *minimum requirements* for the position. She decides to set a 24 hour limit on the test, and funds it with the sign in bonus for the position. The next morning, she is happy to see that Bod gained the credentials.  
What is the chance that Bob randomly guessed it right?  
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: About one in a million.  
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: About one in a billion.  
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: About one in a trillion.  
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: About one in a quadrillion.  
  
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_QUESTION_START: After the two transactions that took place on the previous questionn, which of the following variables did ***NOT*** get stored inside the smart contracts?  
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: The *solving hash*.  
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: The *salt* that was used by Bob.  
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: The *solution hash*.  
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: Bob's address.  

BLOCK_QUALIFIED_QUESTION_START: Which hash function is used by Block Qualified to generate Merkle trees and verify solutions?  
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: SHA3-256.  
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: Poseidon.  
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: Keccak-256.  
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: MIMC7.  
  
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_QUESTION_START: Which of the following zero-knowledge technologies is used by Block Qualified to ensure that users can send their solving transactions privately?  
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: STARKs  
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: PLONK  
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: Bulletproofs  
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: groth16  
  
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_QUESTION_START: What happens if a Block Qualified Tester reaches its *expiration date* without being solved and its prize being claimed?  
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: The funds are lost forever, as they are locked inside the smart contract.  
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: The funds get transferred to the Block Qualified DAO to fund development.  
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: The owner of the tester can choose to delete it and regain their funds.  
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: The tester can still be solved to claim its prize, but only once.  
  
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_QUESTION_START: What is the purpose of the *salt*?  
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: It ensures that solving transactions cannot be replicated.  
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: It guarantees private solving transactions.  
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: It makes two user's proofs for the same solution different.  
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: None of the above.  
  
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_QUESTION_START: In the following figure, which element is being represented by the letter ****C***?  
![Figure 1](https://i.imgur.com/fgJ6pSy.png)  
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: The *solution hash*.  
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: The solver's address.  
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: The *salt*.  
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: The *solution hash*.
