BLOCK_QUALIFIED_QUESTION_START: The Ethereum network is expected to undergo a hard fork sometime during the week of September 19th, 2022. As a result, the consensus algorithm will change from the current Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake, in what has been dubbed as *The Merge*. Which of the following do you expect to happen as a ***direct*** consequence of *The Merge*?

BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: Reduced supply inflation.
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: Increased valuation.
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: All of the above.
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: None of the above.

BLOCK_QUALIFIED_QUESTION_START: Which of the following best define Ethereum's Proof-of-Work?
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: It requires miners arrange the transactions within a block in a correct order. Given that blocks can easily contain more than 100 transactions, this is a very computational task, as it requires checking every possible ordering of all those transactions to see which are valid.
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: It is the only way for new cryptocurrencies to be created, also known as *mining*.
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: It secures the blockchain while keeping control over the system decentralized.
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: It requires miners to guess a number to discover a new block.
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: All of the above.
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: None of the above.

BLOCK_QUALIFIED_QUESTION_START: Which of the following is *not* a characteristic of Ethereum's upcoming Proof-of-Stake?
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: It requires less computational power than Proof-of-Work, up to 99.95% less.
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: Its concept precedes Proof-of-Work.
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: Anyone is able to run a validator node.
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: The punishment to dishonest validators is intrinsic to the blockchain.
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: All of the above.
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: None of the above.

BLOCK_QUALIFIED_QUESTION_START: Which of these is a key difference between Optimistic Rollups and Zero-Knowledge Rollups?
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: The blockchain layer on which they base and derive their security.
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: Their ability to run a Turing complete virtual machine.
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: How transactions are batched and verified.
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: Where most of the computation takes place: whether off-chain or on-chain.
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: All of the above.
BLOCK_QUALIFIED_ANSWER_START: None of the above.
