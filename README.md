#### Zero-Knowledge Proofs:
To ensure **anyone** can obtain credentials, the files needed to generate proofs are pinned on IPFS:
- [bafybeie2civnvp337qpkphcswy7fteyzo3ovwdtumvuvl676vbpy4owwmy](https://bafybeie2civnvp337qpkphcswy7fteyzo3ovwdtumvuvl676vbpy4owwmy.ipfs.dweb.link/verify_answers.wasm)
- [bafybeib76t3xuz3zgwshupevycbkfvgln6a7laqpnnqj2ajiv2sambyfke](https://bafybeib76t3xuz3zgwshupevycbkfvgln6a7laqpnnqj2ajiv2sambyfke.ipfs.dweb.link/verify_answers_final.zkey)
The Block Qualified frontend nevertheless generates the necessary proofs automatically when solving a test, without recording your solution.
