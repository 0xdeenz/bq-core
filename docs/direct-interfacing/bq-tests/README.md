# Block Qualified Tests

Block Qualified supports three different test types:
- **Multiple choice tests**, where the answer to each question is part of a given finite set.
- **Open answer tests**, where the answer to each question can be any value.
- **Mixed tests**, containing both a multiple choice and an open answer component.
