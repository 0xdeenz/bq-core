# Roadmap

An integration with [useWeb3](https://www.useweb3.xyz/) is on the works. This will include a learning and quiz module, with some demo tests that users will be able to solve to prove their knowledge of Ethereum.

As this is expected to be the first live implementation, we will look into gathering feedback to improve the scope of Block Qualified.

As the ideals and principle of Block Qualified line up with those of [Semaphore](http://semaphore.appliedzkp.org/), we also expect to study a potential integration.
